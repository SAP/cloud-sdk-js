[Compatibility Note] `@sap-cloud-sdk/mail-client` package has been removed in v4. As an alternative, implement your own mail client by checking the [v3 implementation](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js/blob/v3-main/packages/mail-client/src/mail-client.ts) and the BTP documentation for [using the TCP protocol for cloud applications](https://help.sap.com/docs/connectivity/sap-btp-connectivity-cf/using-tcp-protocol-for-cloud-applications?locale=en-US).
