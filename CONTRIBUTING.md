# Contributing
Thank you for taking your time to contribute to the SAP Cloud SDK!

## Project Structure
This project containes multiple packages, that are managed using [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) and [yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/).  Productive packages are located in the [`packages`](./packages) directory, test packages are located in the [`test-packages`](./test-packages) directory.
All dependencies that are used in more than one of the packages are hoisted into the root project. Dependencies, that occur only once and binaries will be placed in the node_modules of that specific package. Some of the packages are interdependent, therefore `yarn install` won't work from within those packages. Run `yarn install` in the root directory instead.

## Testing
In order to run all tests, execute:
```sh-session
$ yarn test
```

This will run unit tests for all our packages as well as integration tests and type tests. You can run those individually as described in the following.

### Unit Tests
Unit tests shall test specific modules of a package, units that are tested for behavior.
You can run all unit tests by executing:
```sh-session
$ yarn test:unit
```

To run unit tests for a specific package add the workspace name to the command. For the core package this would be:
```sh-session
$ yarn @sap-cloud-sdk/core run test
```

### Integration Tests
Integration tests shall test how modules behave in combination. The integration tests are located in [`test-packages/integration-tests`](./test-packages/integration-tests).

To run the integration tests, execute:
```sh-session
$ yarn test:integration
```

### Type Tests
As this project is written in TypeScript, it shall be consumable by other TypeScript projects. We use `dtslint` to test that our resulting API meets our expectations.
The type tests are located at [`test-packages/type-tests`](./test-packages/type-tests).

To run the integration tests, execute:
```sh-session
$ yarn test:type
```

### Test Services
To simplify testing we are using tests services. The specifications for those can be found in [`test-resources`](./test-resources).
They are used from different tests on different levels.
The service specifications are directly used by the unit tests of the `generator`.
From the specifications, we generate two OData clients.
First, we generate type script sources, that are generated into the test-utils of the `core`, where we replace all references to the `@sap-cloud-sdk/core` with a reference to the local sources. The resulting test service is used in the unit tests of the `core` package.
Second, we generate a transpiled version of a non-modified OData client based on the specifications, that is located at [`test-packages/test-services`](./test-packages/test-services). This is used in the  integration tests and type tests.

If you need to extend the existing services, run the following to regenerate the OData clients.
```sh-session
$ yarn generate:test-services
```

## Linting
To fix all linting issues, run:
```sh-session
$ yarn lint:fix
```
