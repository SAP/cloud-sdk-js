# SAP Cloud SDK

An SDK to reduce your development effort when building side-by-side extension applications on SAP Business Technology Platform that integrate with SAP solutions and services such as SAP S/4HANA, SAP SuccessFactors, and many others.

## Announcement - Upgrade Strategy

We have released version 2 of the SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript on npm.
Check out the [upgrade guide](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/js/guides/upgrade-to-version-2) for detailed instructions.
The upgrade effort should be around 1 day for an average project and should not take more than a week for larger projects.

It is recommended to upgrade to version 2 as version 1.x will not be actively maintained, with the exception of critical security vulnerabilities for up to 6 months.

Please share your ideas, suggestions or improvements in our [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js/discussions/1518).

## Packages

This project publishes multiple packages and is managed using [turborepo](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo).

### @sap-cloud-sdk/http-client

This package contains the generic http-client functionality with built-in connectivity with `executeHttpRequest()`. The generic http-client adds SAP infrastructure specific functionality on top of a standard HTTP Client.

To install the SAP Cloud SDK http-client in your project, run:

```bash
$ npm install @sap-cloud-sdk/http-client
```

### @sap-cloud-sdk/connectivity

This package contains all Cloud Foundry connectivity service related methods like `getDestination()` and `registerDestination()`.

To install the SAP Cloud SDK conectivity in your project, run:

```bash
$ npm install @sap-cloud-sdk/connectivity
```

### @sap-cloud-sdk/odata-v2

This package contains all OData version 2 specific functionality, like the request builders for create/update operations, predefined filter functions, batch. Package `@sap-cloud-sdk/odata-v4` contains the same functionality for OData verison 4.

To install the SAP Cloud SDK odata-v2 in your project, run:

```bash
$ npm install @sap-cloud-sdk/odata-v2
```

Similarly, to install the SAP Cloud SDK odata-v4, use:

```bash
$ npm install @sap-cloud-sdk/odata-v4
```

### @sap-cloud-sdk/generator

The SAP Cloud SDK generator is a command line interface (CLI) that allows you to create clients for your own OData services or other SAP systems besides SAP S/4HANA based on their service specifications.

To install the SAP Cloud SDK generator in your project, run:

```bash
$ npm install @sap-cloud-sdk/generator
```

### @sap-cloud-sdk/test-util

The test-util package makes writing tests for your SAP Business Technology Platform application more convenient.

To install the SAP Cloud SDK test-util as development dependencies in your project, run:

```bash
$ npm install -D @sap-cloud-sdk/test-util
```

## How to switch to the Open Source version of the SAP Cloud SDK

Please ignore this section, if you have never used the SAP Cloud SDK with a version `< 1.18.0`.
If you are using an old version of the SAP Cloud SDK, you might want to read [how to migrate to this Open Source version of the SAP Cloud SDK](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/js/guides/migrate-to-open-source-version-of-cloud-sdk-for-javascript-typescript).

## Related Projects

### SAP Cloud SDK CLI

The [SAP Cloud SDK command line interface (CLI)](https://github.com/sap/cloud-sdk-cli) is deprecated. We have provided sample projects with example applications to show how you can integrate the SAP Cloud SDK into your projects.

### SAP Cloud SDK Sample Projects

We have created multiple [sample projects](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-sdk-js) which showcase the use of the SAP Cloud SDK for TypeScript/JavaScript in different scenarios.
Each project outlines the configurations needed to execute it locally and to deploy the project to SAP Business Technology Platform.

### Virtual Data Model (VDM)

In addition to the Open Source parts of this project, we also publish the SAP Cloud SDK Virtual Data Model (VDM) - JavaScript / TypeScript clients for the latest versions of the published OData services of SAP S/4HANA Cloud under the SAP Developer license. Those are not included in this project, but rely on modules from this project.

To install an OData client for an SAP S/4HANA service run:

```bash
$ npm install @sap/cloud-sdk-vdm-<service name>-service
```

In the example above, `service name` is the name of the service you want to use, e. g. for the business partner service, run: `npm install @sap/cloud-sdk-vdm-business-partner-service`.

### Project "Piper"

Continuous delivery is a method to develop software with short feedback cycles.
It is applicable to projects both for SAP Business Technology Platform and SAP on-premise platforms.
SAP implements tooling for continuous delivery in the open-source [project "Piper"](https://sap.github.io/jenkins-library/).
The goal of project "Piper" is to substantially ease setting up continuous delivery in your project using SAP technologies.
