## Packages
This project publishes multiple packages and is managed using [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna). To install any of the packages make sure you have an `.npmrc` in your project, that references the `@sap` npm registry like this: `@sap:registry=https://npm.sap.com`.
To use the SDK in your project, we recommend using our [commandline interface](#sap-cloud-sdk-cli).

### @sap-cloud-sdk/core
The core is the heart of the SAP Cloud SDK and contains the functionality that is essential to every project powered by the SDK. Any OData client built by the SAP Cloud SDK, be it the VDM or clients built by the generator are using the core. We recommend to install this in addition to your clients.

To install the SAP Cloud SDK core in your project, run:
```sh-session
$ npm install @sap-cloud-sdk/core
```

### @sap-cloud-sdk/generator
The SAP Cloud SDK generator is a command line interface (CLI) that allows you to create clients for your own OData services or other SAP systems besides SAP S/4HANA based on their service specifications.

To install the SAP Cloud SDK generator in your project, run:
```sh-session
$ npm install @sap-cloud-sdk/generator
```

### @sap-cloud-sdk/test-util
The test-util package makes writing tests for your SAP Cloud Platform application more convenient.

To install the SAP Cloud SDK test-util as development dependencies in your project, run:
```sh-session
$ npm install -D @sap-cloud-sdk/test-util
```

## API documentations
We use GitHub Pages for our API documentations, the link can be found [here](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/api/).

## How to switch to the Open Source version of the SAP Cloud SDK
Please ignore this section, if you have never used the SAP Cloud SDK with a version `< 1.18.0`.
If you are using an old version of the SAP Cloud SDK, you might want to read [how to migrate to this Open Source version of the SAP Cloud SDK](./knowledge-base/how-to-switch-to-os-cloud-sdk.md).

## Related Projects

### SAP Cloud SDK CLI
To reduce the development effort even more, you can use the [SAP Cloud SDK command line interface (CLI)](https://github.com/sap/cloud-sdk-cli) to start a new [NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) project, including the SDK right from the get go and supporting you do deploy your project to SAP Cloud Platform.

### Virtual Data Model (VDM)
In addition to the Open Source parts of this project, we also publish the SAP Cloud SDK Virtual Data Model (VDM) - JavaScript / TypeScript clients for the latest versions of the whitelisted OData services of SAP S/4HANA Cloud under the SAP Developer licence. Those are not included in this project, but rely on modules from this project.

To install an OData client for an SAP S/4HANA service, make sure you have an `.npmrc` in the root of your project, that contains a reference to the the SAP npm registry: `@sap:registry=https://npm.sap.com`.

Then run:
```sh-session
$ npm install @sap-cloud-sdk/core
```

### Project "Piper"
Continuous delivery is a method to develop software with short feedback cycles.
It is applicable to projects both for SAP Cloud Platform and SAP on-premise platforms.
SAP implements tooling for continuous delivery in the open-source [project "Piper"](https://sap.github.io/jenkins-library/).
The goal of project "Piper" is to substantially ease setting up continuous delivery in your project using SAP technologies.

Part of project "Piper" is the [SAP Cloud SDK Pipeline](https://sap.github.io/jenkins-library/pipelines/cloud-sdk/introduction/) which is tailor-made to deliver high-quality applications on SAP Cloud Platform using the SAP Cloud SDK for Java and for JavaScript.
