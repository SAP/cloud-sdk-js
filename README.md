## How we write

### Language and style

- Being concise is a virtue. Write short and on purpose.
- Avoid abbreviations or introduce them unless it's absolutely obvious and widely adopted.
- Don't sell, don't do marketing, the value comes from the content itself, not you words of accolade to our work. Leave that for Blogs and even there be humble.
- Use simple vocabulary and the most frequent words. Try thesaurus for matching your vocabulary.

### Content and structure

- Provide only relevant context. Make a good assumption of readers' knowledge and make it your starting point for context.
- Give a link whenever you mention 3rd party resources, library, concept, abbreviation, reference, etc.
- Build upon already available content and use it for reference. Create materials that could be leveraged by others.
  - Think modular. Extract logically independent parts and link to them from larger scope materials.
  - Use the same approach you do with coding when structuring your application
  - Increase scalability so that others can leverage your work
  - Generalize up to the level where it makes sense but not more

### Quality

- Be your reader, make it a candy
- Write incrementally. Every little update counts. It saves you time. Editing is easier than writing from scratch in most cases.
- Use spell checker at all times

### Feedback and review

- Ask if your peers understood what you meant
- Get inspiration from good documentation! Check documentation from the best companies in the area, prominent startups, and other quality sources to collect ideas and set yourself for success.
- Give quality feedback to your colleagues. Suggest changes that improve our documentation quality.
