## Best DevOps practices at SAP ##
Continuous integration and delivery are fundamental practices for building cloud native applications.

### Continuous delivery toolkit ###

SAP Cloud SDK for Continuous Delivery is Open Source and easy to use.

[The GitHub repository](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-s4-sdk-pipeline) contains a Jenkins Pipeline-as-Code that enables
development teams to assure a high level of quality on the process as well as code level. While the SAP Cloud SDK enables us to
build high-quality cloud applications, this pipeline helps to assure high quality on the project level by a set of standard
and SDK-specific quality checks.

### Project Piper ###

In great park pipeline and action configuration for Cloud SDK is based on open-sourced SAP library dubbed [Project
Piper](https://sap.github.io/jenkins-library/guidedtour/ ).

[Please, check the official documentation for more details.](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-s4-sdk-pipeline)
