## Best DevOps practices at SAP ##

Continuous delivery is a method to develop software with short feedback cycles.
It is applicable to projects both for SAP Cloud Platform and SAP on-premise platforms.
SAP implements tooling for continuous delivery in project "Piper".
The goal of project "Piper" is to substantially ease setting up continuous delivery in your project using SAP technologies.

### SAP Cloud SDK for Continuous Delivery ###

[SAP Cloud SDK for Continuous Delivery](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-s4-sdk-pipeline) is open source and free to use.
This ready-made pipeline is part of project "Piper" and allows you to start with continuous delivery without writing any pipeline code -- only declarative configuration is required.
It helps you to quickly deliver high quality applications to SAP Cloud Platform.

Check out the [documentation of SAP Cloud SDK for Continuous Delivery](https://sap.github.io/jenkins-library/pipelines/cloud-sdk/introduction/) for more details and usage hints.

### Project "Piper" ###
