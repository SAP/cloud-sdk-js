## Best DevOps practices at SAP ##

Continuous delivery is a method to develop software with short feedback cycles.
It is applicable to projects both for SAP Cloud Platform and SAP on-premise platforms.
SAP implements tooling for continuous delivery in project "Piper" and SAP Cloud SDK for Continuous Delivery.
The goal of project "Piper" is to substantially ease setting up continuous delivery in your project using SAP technologies.

### SAP Cloud SDK for Continuous Delivery ###

SAP Cloud SDK for Continuous Delivery is Open Source and easy to use.

[The GitHub repository](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-s4-sdk-pipeline) contains a Jenkins Pipeline-as-Code that enables development teams to assure a high level of quality on the process as well as code level.
While the SAP Cloud SDK enables us to build high-quality cloud applications, this pipeline helps to assure high quality on the project level by a set of standard and SDK-specific quality checks.

### Project "Piper" ###

For more information on CI/CD in the SAP ecosytem, please refer to the documentation of [project "Piper"](https://sap.github.io/jenkins-library).
It also holds the [documentation of SAP Cloud SDK for Continuous Delivery](https://sap.github.io/jenkins-library/pipelines/cloud-sdk/introduction/).
