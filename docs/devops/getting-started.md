## Best DevOps practices at SAP ##
Continuous integration and delivery are pillars for contemporary application development. DevOps is the first class
citizen in SAP Cloud SDK and shipped as best practice with all generated project templates.

### Continuous delivery toolkit ###

SAP Cloud SDK for Pipeline is Open Source.

[This repository](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-s4-sdk-pipeline) contains a Jenkins Pipeline-as-Code that enables
development teams to assure a high level of quality on the process as well as code level. While the SAP Cloud SDK enables us to
build high-quality cloud applications, this pipeline helps to assure high quality on the project level by a set of standard
and SDK-specific quality checks.

### Project Piper ###

In great park pipeline and action configuration for Cloud SDK is based on open-sourced SAP library dubbed [Project
Piper](https://sap.github.io/jenkins-library/guidedtour/ ).
