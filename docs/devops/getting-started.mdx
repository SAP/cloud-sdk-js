## Best DevOps practices at SAP ##

Continuous delivery is a method to develop software with short feedback cycles.
It applies to projects both for SAP Cloud Platform and SAP on-premise platforms.
SAP implements tooling for continuous delivery in the project "Piper".
The goal of the project "Piper" is to substantially ease setting up continuous delivery in your project using SAP technologies.

### SAP Cloud SDK for Continuous Delivery ###

[SAP Cloud SDK for Continuous Delivery](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-s4-sdk-pipeline) is open source and free to use.
This ready-made pipeline is part of the project "Piper" and allows you to start with continuous delivery without writing any pipeline code -- only declarative configuration is required.
It helps you to quickly deliver high-quality applications to SAP Cloud Platform.

Check out the [documentation of SAP Cloud SDK for Continuous Delivery](https://sap.github.io/jenkins-library/pipelines/cloud-sdk/introduction/) for more details and usage hints.
