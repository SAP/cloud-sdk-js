## Generic questions ##

### How often do you release a new SDK version?

We release [bi-weekly](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.sap.cloud.sdk/sdk-bom). All the features that are in _Generally Available_ or _Beta_ state get into the next release. You can find the latest SDK version and the list
of previous releases [here](release-notes-sap-cloud-sdk-for-java) or on [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.sap.cloud.sdk/sdk-bom).

### Do you release hotfixes?

Yes, we do. They usually have a higher `patch` number according to [semver](https://semver.org/), i.e: 3.19.1 instead of 3.19.0. Check our [release notes](release-notes-sap-cloud-sdk-for-java) for
more details.

### Should I update with every release?

The general recommendation is _YES_. This way you'll reduce the effort to keep up with the fast pace of cloud development. We try to keep stable functionality consistent and explicitly notify about breaking changes. Be cautious about using features annotated as _Beta_ because their API can change with every release.

### Which Java versions are supported by the SDK?

The SDK itself is compatible with Java 8 and 11. Other Java versions may work as well depending on your setup but are not yet tested by us. Note that SAP Cloud Plattform Cloud Foundry environment only supports Java 8 out of the box but can be configured to also run with Java 11. SAP Cloud Plattform Neo only supports Java 8.

### Can I use features annotated as Beta in production?

We __do not recommend__ using API that is marked unstable in the productive code. We do not guarantee any API compatibility for future updates and the features might be experimental. You can use these features to test cutting edge functionality, provide us feedback, and plan migration steps when _Beta_ features are releases as _General Availability_.

### I think I found a bug in the SDK, what should I do?

Please, report it to us via any available channel. The preferred support channel is [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sap-cloud-sdk ). You can also create an issue on the Cloud SDK external GitHub repository or use the internal one if you're SAP employee.

### I'm creating a BCP incident, what's your component name?

Choose `XX-S4C-SDK` if you are reporting an issue via BCP.

## OData related questions ##

### What versions of OData protocol do you support?

We support OData v2 and OData v4 services. You can use pre-generated client libraries supplied with SDK or generate your client from the SDK specification. [Find more details here.](features/odata/overview )

### Do you support ALL OData features?

We support most of the OData features that are exposed by SAP services. However, the [OData specification](https://www.odata.org/documentation/) is huge and contains many features that would see rare to no use. If you found a feature that you need but it is not yet supported by Cloud SDK for Java, please, make a feature request via email cloudsdk[at]sap.com or create an issue towards one of our repositories.

### I receive an OData error/exception when using Cloud SDK for Java

You may see some errors while developing. These errors are not always caused by flaws in the SDK as we often see inconsistent OData protocol handling by different services. Some of them even have known flaws for which we have workarounds. If you can't solve your issue via debugging and experimenting, please, report your incident via [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sap-cloud-sdk ) or our GitHub repositories.

## REST related questions ##

### Do you support REST client libraries?

Yes, we do. We do not release a public REST client generator as of yet. We have a set of libraries supplied together with Cloud SDK for Java. Some of them are available only for SAP internal use, others like Workflow service on Cloud Foundry is released publicly. Check our [REST capabilities](features/rest/overview) and let us know if you need a library for an SAP service that you use and know to be providing REST API.

## Questions about SAP Cloud Platform

### Do you support SAP Cloud Platform - Cloud Foundry?

SAP Cloud SDK for Java has first-class support for [SCP Cloud Foundry](https://www.sap.com/products/cloud-platform.html). We provide plenty of helpful abstractions for [connectivity](features/connectivity/sdk-connectivity-destination-service) and authentication that make developing Apps a pleasant and rewarding experience. Let us know if you're missing any features about SCP Cloud Foundry support from SAP Cloud SDK for Java.

### Do you support SAP Cloud Platform - Neo?

We still provide fully-fledged support Neo environment. However, we do not recommend starting new projects with SAP Cloud Platform Neo as Cloud Foundry is better suited for Apps and S/4HANA extensions development.
