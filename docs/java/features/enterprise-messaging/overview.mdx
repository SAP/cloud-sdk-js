Current approach of Enterprise Mesasging in the SAP Cloud SDK for Java relies on a library developed by SAP Cloud Application Model. Follow the official documentation on the [CAP Messaging API for Event Consumption](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/pages/cap/java/messaging-api#event-consumption) for further reference.

:::note
The type-safe client for S/4HANA Enterprise Messaging from SAP Cloud SDK for Java is deprecated. From now on the library from CAP is a default way for message consumption.
