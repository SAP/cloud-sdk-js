## Overview

With its expressive name **Currency conversion** extension is a convenient library that targets a ubiquitous business case of converting between currencies in your cloud application.

## Getting started

Edit you `pom.xml` file and add Currency Conversion library to your dependencies.

```xml
<dependency>
   <groupId>com.sap.cloud.sdk.services</groupId>
   <artifactId>currency-conversion-core</artifactId>
   <!-- Please, use the latest version of the dependency -->
   <version>3.X.X</version>
</dependency>
```
If your IDE haven't resolved the dependencies run `mvn clean install` in the root directory of you project.

## Features

### Convert Currencies

#### Get currency exchange rates converted from a base currency to a target currency

```java
//example code
```

#### Get Bulk Conversions
Get multiple currency pairs converted through a single call. You can use the library methods to get more than one currency pair converted at the same time.

```java
//example code
```

#### Get Direct and Indirect Conversions
Get direct and indirect currency conversions for your currency pairs. Direct conversions are one-to-one conversions between a source and a target currency. Indirect conversions are performed by using inverse rates or a reference currency.

```java
//example code
```

#### Use Integration Objects
Use integration objects that contain data models and UIs, and services that operate on the data models that you can use to send information to the Currency Conversion library.

```java
//example code
```

#### Multi-tenancy with Currency Conversion
Based on the dependency added to pom.xml, the library identifies the environment you are operating on and identifies the tenant context. The library automatically derives the tenant context by using the Tenant abstraction provided by the SAP Cloud SDK. To override the default conversion configuration, manually add an exchange rate provider and an exchange rate provider code to the API request, as follows. If you do this, the default configuration settings are not taken into consideration.

```java
TenantAccessor.executeWithTenant(providerTenant, CallableWhichPerformsCurrencyConversion);

TenantAccessor.executeWithTenant(() -> “MyProviderTenant”, () -> {
  // Call currency conversion library here.
});
```
## Demo App using Currency Conversion

To demonstrate an end to end use case for the currency conversion library we created a [guide based on a demo App](currency-conversion-demo-app) deployed to SAP Cloud Platform - Cloud Foundry.
