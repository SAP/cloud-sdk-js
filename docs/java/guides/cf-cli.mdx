## Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (CLI)

To deploy your App developed with SAP Cloud SDK to [SAP Cloud Platform](https://www.sap.com/products/cloud-platform.html)
you'll need Cloud Foundry CLI. You can download latest release of DEB package [from official CF GitHub
repository](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases) or follow
[instructions](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#installing-using-a-package-manager) to install it with you package
manager: `apt-get`, `yum` and `homebrew` are supported.

After installing the CLI you might need to reload you shell before it becomes available. To check if it works run:

``` bash
cf
```

## Bind your CLI to SAP Cloud Foundry

Let's associate you Cloud Foundry (CF) CLI to your SAP account by providing an API endpoint and logging in with your
account.

**Select endpoint depending on your region:**

  - Europe <https://api.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com>
  - US East: <https://api.cf.us10.hana.ondemand.com>
  - US CENTRAL: <https://api.cf.us20.hana.ondemand.com>

To use a snippet for Europe run:

```bash
cf api https://api.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com
```

Provide your credential for SAP Cloud Foundry by running:

``` bash
cf login
```
