description: This document will give you an overview of the different tutorials for the SAP Cloud SDK for Java.
---

To give you a quick and easy start into developing with Cloud SDK for Java we created a set of comprehensive tutorials split into missions and groups for a convenient learning path. They'll help you kick-start your project and get you up to speed with the most frequent use-cases and valuable features of the SDK.

## Tutorial Overview

Tutorials can be grouped. A group is a series of individual tutorials. A mission consists of groups and/or individual tutorials. In this way, you can carry out more extensive and meaningful learning experience. We recommend creating an account to keep track of your progress.

### Missions

Missions are the first point of contact if you want to familiarize yourself with the SAP Cloud SDK for Java and want to achieve certain goals.

### Further Material

[Max Streifeneder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/max-streifeneder-72a0955b/) shows the Cloud SDK in a couple of video-guides.

#### Getting started

This great **Getting Started** video-guide by [Max Streifeneder](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkzNZP9fzLxRyhnGT2ziSRw) will help you to familiarize yourself with Cloud SDK development model and give an example of consuming Workflow service via its REST API on SAP Cloud Platform.

#### Destinations and Cloud Connector

Cloud Native applications are no piece of cake when you have to connect to **On Premise** systems and deliver Apps or extensions on top of that.
Well, in SAP Cloud SDK for Java we think otherwise!
To prove it we provide convenient abstractions over destinations to let you seamlessly connect to your **On Premise** system from your cloud app.
What to know how?
Watch this comprehensive video tutorial by [Max Streifeneder](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkzNZP9fzLxRyhnGT2ziSRw) and check our docs on [connectivity](../features/connectivity/sdk-connectivity-destination-service)

#### Generating an OData Client

Imagine you need to develop an App that integrates with OData service.
Maybe you also want to host it on SAP Cloud Platform?
This might be a painstaking task.
This video tutorial shows how to minimize your efforts and simplify everything to the limit.
All you have to do is use SAP Cloud SDK for Java and have your hands on a API definition which is usually `EDMX` file.
In case you have access to your service, the simplest way to get it is by using `/$metadata` endpoint and saving it to a file.

In this video SAP developers' advocate [Max Streifeneder](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkzNZP9fzLxRyhnGT2ziSRw) will take you step by step to success.
Your can also check our docs on generating [Odata type-safe client](../features/odata/generate-typed-odata-v2-and-v4-client-for-java).
