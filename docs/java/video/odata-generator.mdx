Imagine you need to develop an App that integrates with OData service. Maybe you also want to host it on SAP Cloud Platform? This might be a painstaking task. This video tutorial shows how to minimize your efforts and simplify everything to the limit. All you have to do is use SAP Cloud SDK for Java and have your hands on a API definition which is usually `EDMX` file. In case you have access to your service, the simplest way to get it is by using `/$metadata` endpoint and saving it to a file.
