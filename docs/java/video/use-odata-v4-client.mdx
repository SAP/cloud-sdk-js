Let's imaging you're building and App in the SAP Cloud Platform that calls OData v4 API from one or many SAP services exposed by S4/HANA, Success Factors, C4C, and others. OData v4 is a complex protocol based on REST that has a pretty steep learning curve. Every service is unique and can choose what API features to expose. You can shorten your path to success by leveraging a type-safe OData v4 client from Cloud SDK for Java and discover available APIs directly from your IDE.

To simplify it, we recorded this Community Call session about using a type-safe client for Java. Enjoy the hands-on experience delivered by SDK developers!
