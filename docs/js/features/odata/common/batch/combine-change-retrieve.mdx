In the example below, the changesets will be executed first, and then retrieve requests will be executed sequentially afterward. The order of execution within the changeset is not defined.
The first `BatchResponse` will be the response to the changeset. The rest will be the responses for your retrieve requests.

```ts
const [updateChangesetResponse, ...retrieveResponses] =
  await batch(
    changeset(...updateRequests),
    ...retrieveRequests
  )
  .execute(destination);
```
