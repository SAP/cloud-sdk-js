A batch request can consist of multiple changeset. As shown in the example below, the `changeset1` will be executed first followed by the `changeset2`.
In contrast to the operations within a changeset, which have no defined order of execution as state already before.
```ts
const changeset1 = changeset(...updateRequests1);
const changeset2 = changeset(...updateRequests2);

const [changesetResponse1, changesetResponse2] =
  await batch(
    changeset1,
    changeset2,
  )
  .execute(destination);
```
