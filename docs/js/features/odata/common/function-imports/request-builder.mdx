The [function imports request builder](pathname:///api/1.28.1/classes/sap_cloud_sdk_core.functionimportrequestbuilderv2) helps build a request for a service operation containing parameters in a typesave way.
This time, as an example, the [`Warehouse Outbound Delivery Order Service`](https://api.sap.com/api/API_WHSE_OUTB_DLV_ORDER/resource) is used, because not all the services contain function imports like the `Business Partner Service`.
The type safe client for the `Warehouse Outbound Delivery Order Service` can be found in the package `@sap/cloud-sdk-vdm-warehouse-outbound-delivery-order-service`.

The example below creates a function import request builder for the service operation `PostGoodsIssue` and then execute it against your service.
```ts
postGoodsIssue({outboundDeliveryOrder: "order"})
  .execute(destination);
```
The service operation is defined in the service metadata.
