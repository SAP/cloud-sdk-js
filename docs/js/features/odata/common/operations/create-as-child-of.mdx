Assume you have already created a business partner and would like to add a new address to it:
```ts
const existingBusinessPartner = await BusinessPartner.requestBuilder().getByKey(myID).execute(myDestination);

const newAddress = BusinessPartnerAddress.builder()
  .country('DE')
  .postalCode('14469')
  .cityName('Potsdam')
  .streetName('Konrad-Zuse-Ring')
  .houseNumber('10')
  .build()
```
This can be done by using the `asChildOf` method which allows to create an entity as a child of an existing entity.
You need to give the parent object and the field connecting the two entities:
```ts
BusinessPartnerAddress.requestBuilder()
  .create(newAddress)
  .asChildOf(existingBusinessPartner,BusinessPartner.TO_BUSINESS_PARTNER_ADDRESS)
  .execute(myDestination)
```
