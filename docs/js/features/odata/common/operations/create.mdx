The Create request builder allows you to send a `POST` request to create a new entity:

```ts
const businessPartner = BusinessPartner.builder().build();
BusinessPartner.requestBuilder().create(businessPartner);
```

In the example above we created an instance of BusinessPartner and sent it to the BusinessPartner service in a `POST` request.
