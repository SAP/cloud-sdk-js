The Delete request builder allows you to create `DELETE` requests, that delete an entity.

```ts
/*
  The following won't work on the real SAP S/4HANA BusinessPartner service because BusinessPartners cannot be deleted.
  We added this only for the sake of the example.
*/
BusinessPartner.requestBuilder().delete(businessPartner);
```

Entities can only be deleted if [ETags](#handling-of-etags) match. If you want to force deletion of the entity regardless of the ETag configure the request to ignore version identifiers with `ignoreVersionIdentifier`:

```ts
BusinessPartner.requestBuilder()
  .delete(businessPartner)
  .ignoreVersionIdentifier();
```

You can also overwrite ETags using `setVersionIdentifier`:

```ts
BusinessPartner.requestBuilder()
  .delete(businessPartner)
  .setVersionIdentifier('etag');
```

In the example above the ETag 'ETag' is being used instead of the original one.
