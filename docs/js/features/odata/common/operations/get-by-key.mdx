The GetByKey request builder allows you to create a request to retrieve one entity based on its key:

```ts
BusinessPartner.requestBuilder().getByKey('id');
```

The example above retrieves the BusinessPartner with the id 'id'.

The result can be restricted by applying the [select](#select) function, same as in the [GetAll](#getall-request-builder) request.
