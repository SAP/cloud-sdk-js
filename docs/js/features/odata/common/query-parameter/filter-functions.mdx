There are predefined filter functions e. g. `length`, `substring`, `substringOf` in the core library, that allow for a wide range of filter expressions:

```ts
/*
  Fetch all business partners who have a first name shorter than 5 letters
*/
BusinessPartner.requestBuilder()
  .getAll()
  .filter(length(BusinessPartner.FIRST_NAME).lessThan(5))
  .execute(destination);
```
