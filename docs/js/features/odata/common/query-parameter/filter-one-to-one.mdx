In addition to basic properties, filters can also be applied on one-to-one navigation properties.
The example below shows how to filter on the `TO_CUSTOMER`, which is a one-to-one navigation property of the BusinessPartner entity.
Please note, the `CUSTOMER_NAME` and `CUSTOMER_FULL_NAME` are properties of the entity `Customer`, which is the type of the one-to-one navigation property `TO_CUSTOMER`.
```ts
/*
  Get all business partners that match all the following conditions:
    - Have customer with the customer name 'name'
    - Have customer with the customer full name 'fullName'
*/
.filter(
  BusinessPartner.TO_CUSTOMER.filter(
    Customer.CUSTOMER_NAME.equals('name'),
    Customer.CUSTOMER_FULL_NAME.equals('fullName')
  )
)
```
The generated `$filter` will be:
```sql
$filter=((to_Customer/CustomerName eq 'name' and to_Customer/CustomerFullName eq 'fullName'))
```
