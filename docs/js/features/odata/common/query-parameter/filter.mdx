When operating on a collection of entities the API offers `filter( ... )` on the builders. It directly corresponds to the `$filter` parameter of the request. Filters are also built via the static property fields on entities:

```ts
/*
  Get all business partners that either:
    - Have first name 'Alice' but not last name 'Bob'
    - Or have first name 'Mallory'
*/
BusinessPartner.requestBuilder()
  .getAll()
  .filter(
    or(
      and(
        BusinessPartner.FIRST_NAME.equals('Alice'),
        BusinessPartner.LAST_NAME.notEquals('Bob')
      ),
      BusinessPartner.FIRST_NAME.equals('Mallory')
    )
  )
  .execute(destination);
```

The example above will translate to this filter parameter:
```sql
$filter=(((FirstName eq 'Alice') and (LastName ne 'Bob')) or (FirstName eq 'Mallory'))
```

Take note of the order of `and` and `or`. As `or` is invoked on the result of `and` it will form the outer expression while `and` is an inner expression in the first branch of `or`.

It is also possible to pass multiple filters to the same filter function without concatenating them with `and` or `or`. They will be concatenated with `and` by default. The two following examples are equal:

```ts
.filter(
  and(
    BusinessPartner.FIRST_NAME.equals('Alice'),
    BusinessPartner.LAST_NAME.notEquals('Bob')
  )
)
```

The example above can be shortened to:

```ts
.filter(
  BusinessPartner.FIRST_NAME.equals('Alice'),
  BusinessPartner.LAST_NAME.notEquals('Bob')
)
```
