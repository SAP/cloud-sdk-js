:::danger OData v4 is experimental and not ready for production
Typed client for OData v4 is under heavy development and was released only as `experimental/Beta`. Please, use it on you own discretion. We'll explicitly communicate in the release notes when it's stable and general availability.
:::

For more details on **how to execute requests** using a (pre-)generated OData client refer to [this documentation](./execute-odata-request).
