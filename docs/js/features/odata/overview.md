## What OData protocol versions are supported?

| OData protocol version                                                      | Cloud SDK for JavaScript |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| [OData v2](odata-v2-client)         | &#10003;                 |
| [OData v4](odata-v4-client) in Beta | &#10003;                 |


## What is OData?

[OData](https://www.odata.org/) is an open standard for building and consuming RESTful APIs. It defines a query language to send and retrieve data via HTTP and to perform operations on data.

There are two widely used versions of the protocol: OData v2 and OData v4. The latter comes with more and improved functionality. Full details on the standards are to be found in the [documentation](https://www.odata.org/documentation/).

## What does the Cloud SDK offer?

The Cloud SDK simplifies consumption of OData services through the following features:

### Type-safe OData client

- We provide a type-safe OData client to build and execute OData requests in JavaScript and Typescript.
- For many popular SAP OData services we ship pre-generated type-safe clients. In SAP universe they are called Virtual Data Model or VDM. The most popular type-safe client module contains a collection of [all OData services of SAP S/4HANA Cloud](https://api.sap.com/package/SAPS4HANACloud?section=Artifacts)
- We support both OData v2 and OData v4 protocols in the SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript.

### Code generator

If you need a client for an OData service where we do not ship a pre-generated client use our versatile [code generator](generate-typed-odata-v2-and-v4-client-for-javascript-and-typescript) to convert OData service definition into type-safe Java client library. You can do it for any service either developed by yourself, provided by SAP or other 3rd party.

- Service definition usually comes in form of `.edmx` file and contains metadata of Odata service. The simplest way to obtain it if you have access to the service is navigating to `http(s)://<service-path>/$metadata` endpoint. You can easily generate a client for any 3rd party service or a service that you've build on you own.
- You can invoke code generator via our command line interface (CLI)

### Connectivity

We simplify connectivity to SAP enabled OData services via type-safe abstractions over [Destinations](../connectivity/destination-js-sdk), Authentication and some other related concepts.
