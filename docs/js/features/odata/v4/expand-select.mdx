In contrast to the OData v2 implementation, you have to `select` and `expand` separately.
In other words selected properties are not expanded automatically as in v2.

```ts
People.requestBuilder().getAll()
    .select(People.LAST_NAME)
    .expand(People.FRIENDS.select(People.FIRST_NAME,People.ADDRESS_INFO))
```

In the example above you select the `LAST_NAME` of the root entity and expand the navigation property `FRIENDS`.
In the expanded entity the selected fields are `FIRST_NAME` and `ADDRESS_INFO`.

The generated URL for this request will be:
```sql
/People?$select=LastName&$expand=Friends($select=FirstName,AddressInfo)
```
If no select is given, all non-navigational properties are included in the response.
