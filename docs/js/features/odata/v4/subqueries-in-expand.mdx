Note that you can create very complex queries within the expand scope:
```ts
People.requestBuilder().getAll()
    .expand(People.FRIENDS
      .select(People.FIRST_NAME,People.ADDRESS_INFO)
      .filter(People.LAST_NAME.equals("Miller"))
      .orderBy(asc(People.GENDER))
      .top(1)
      .skip(1)
    )
```

In this example the filter will reduce the friends to be shown.
The effect of a filter depends whether it is used in or outside of an expand.
The different cases are explained in [Filters in Expand.](#filterParentChildren)

The URL for the query will be:
```sql
/People?$expand=Friends($select=FirstName,AddressInfo;$filter=(LastName eq 'Miller');$skip=1;$top=1;$orderby=Gender asc)
```
