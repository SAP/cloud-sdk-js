The SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript can be used both as a backend and frontend library when used in a browser.
Because of the specifics of a browser environment, some features might be unavailable.
To help you get up and running faster in a browser, we'll outline the main steps and caveats of using SDK on the frontend.
We will use `Angular` to illustrate the usage.

## Prerequisite

You have a front-end application set up.
For example an [Angular application](https://angular.io/cli/new) via `ng new myProject`.

## Include the SDK

For most examples we will use the business partner API.
Add the package `@sap/cloud-sdk-vdm-business-partner-service` to your package.json introduce some call via:
```
//In the .html part of the component
<button (click)="callApi()">Click me!</button>

//In the .ts part of the component
import {BusinessPartner} from '@sap/cloud-sdk-vdm-business-partner-service'

async function callApi(){
    const result await BusinessPartner.requestBuilder().getAll().execute(myDest)
    console.log(result)
}
```

:::note
For the destination lookup the SDK relies on `Node.js` functionality like `process.env` for example.
However, the request building, execution and result parsing does not require any `Node.js` modules and can be used in the front-end.
Hence you have to create the destination variable `myDest` manually.
:::

When you run `npm run build` your project should compile.
Currently, we are facing compilation errors of the kind `Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'https' in ...'`
Please check out the [workaround](#workaround) for these kinds of errors.

## Run Locally

As discussed above the `myDest` can not be fetched via the destination service.
When you run locally you can simply provide it
```
import {Destination} from '@sap-cloud-sdk/core'

const myDest:Destination = {
  url: 'https://my123456.s4hana.ondemand.com',
  username: 'myUser',
  password: 'myPassowrd'
}
```

When you execute `npm run serve` your project is compiled and hosted on a local server.

:::note
When you trigger a request from a browser to the remote system all modern browsers will block this to ensure [same origin policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy).
One simple way to overcome this issue locally is to disable the web security of your  browser temporarily (e.g. --disable-web-security for Chrome)
Alternatively, you can also create a second localhost proxy server which adds the `access-allow-origin-header` to the request.
:::

## Run On Cloud Foundry

For productive usage, the methods mentioned above for running locally are of course not needed.
You simply configure the `xs-app.json` of the used app-router with an entry like this:
```
 {
    "source": "/REMOTE-SYSTEM-IDENTIFIER/(.*)",
    "target": "/$1",
    "destination": "DESTINATION-NAME-ON-CF"
  }
```

and then in your application simply define the destination as:
```
import {Destination} from '@sap-cloud-sdk/core'

const myDest:Destination = {
  url: '/REMOTE-SYSTEM-IDENTIFIER'
}
```

The created request to `/REMOTE-SYSTEM-IDENTIFIER/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/A_BusinessPartner` will be matched by the app-router and the destination with the given URL and credentials is used.

:::note
This approach does not support principal propagation to On-Premise systems.
For this you need a JWT and need to include the proper header fields defining the user.
See the documentation on [On-Premise systems](../features/connectivity/on-premise.mdx) for details.
:::

:::note
With webpack it is possible to [load resources](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/normal-module-replacement-plugin/) for local or a productive usage.
Using such a switch you can easily adjust the value of the destination for the two cases.

## Workaround

Currently, we are facing the issue, that on compilation from TS to JS the `Node.js` parts cause problems even if they are not used.
We hope to resolve these issues in the future but here is a workaround:

- Include @angular-builders/custom-webpack to the dev dependencies
- Create a custom webpack config named `node-webpack.config.js` and list the following node modules:
```
module.exports={
     node: {
       crypto: true,
       stream: true,
       zlib: true,
       path: true,
       os: true,
       http: true,
       https: true
     }
   }
```
- In the `angular.json` adjust the `build` target to use the custom builder:
```
 "build": {
          "builder": "@angular-builders/custom-webpack:browser",
          "options": {
            "customWebpackConfig": {
              "path": "./node-webpack.config.js"
            }...
```
- In the `angular.json adjust the `serve` target to use the custom builder as well:
```
 "serve": {
          "builder": "@angular-builders/custom-webpack:dev-server",
```
- In the package.json exclude the node modules not existing in the browser:
```
"browser": {
      "fs": false,
      "net": false,
      "tls": false
    }
```
Now the project should build and the run locally.
