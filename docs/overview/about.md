## Introduction ##
The Cloud SDK is a set of tools and libraries for consuming, building or extending SAP services and applications in the
cloud native way and deploying them to SAP Cloud Platform.

SAP Cloud SDK was conceived as a collection of best practices for developing cloud native applications withing SAP. Eventually
it grew into a fully-fledged and [feature rich](key-features ) development library consisting of three main components.

### Cloud SDK components ###

- [Cloud SDK for Java](../java/introduction )
- [Cloud SDK for JavaScript (Node.js)](../js/introduction )
- [Cloud SDK for CI/CD](../devops/getting-started )

### Organic part of SAP Cloud Ecosystem ###

### Open Source ###
The SAP Cloud SDK actively works in the direction of open sourcing most of its code. We endorse best open standards and
technologies to simplify developer's life and stay ahead of the curve. It's almost impossible to develop such a product
as a closed source only. As of today we already open sourced SDK for [JavaScript](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk ) and
[CI/CD](https://sap.github.io/jenkins-library/ )  to raise transparency, allow developers easily access our source code,
integrate it in their Apps and contribute back into SDK to make it better.

On the other hand we're remaining main contributors to every SDK component and continue actively developing them to
ensure highest quality and seamless integration with other SAP solutions.
