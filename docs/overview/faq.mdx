## What programming languages can I use?

You can code in [Java](../java/getting-started.mdx) or [JavaScript](../js/getting-started.mdx)

## Cloud SDK & [CAP](../related-projects/cap.mdx)? What is the difference?

Cloud Application Programming model (CAP) and SAP Cloud SDK are complementary tools to publish and consume APIs like OData and REST. They play nicely together to cover the full stack of cloud-native application development. The SAP CAP plays more on the API and service publishing side, while SAP Cloud SDK deals more with API consumption and deployment of applications to SAP Cloud Platform.

You can easily use SAP Cloud SDK and CAP together in one project. Find more details about CAP [here](../related-projects/cap.mdx ) and check out our [tutorial about using Cloud SDK for Java and CAP together](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cloudsdk-integrate-cap.html).

## Can I run SAP Cloud SDK App locally

Yes you can. Check respective documentation for [Java](../java/getting-started.mdx) and [JavaScript](../js/getting-started.mdx#run-the-project) you expedience any issues let us know via our support channels.
