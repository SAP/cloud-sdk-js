## About CAP ##

The SAP Cloud Application Programming Model is an [open and opinionated](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/about/#design-principles), [framework of languages, libraries, and tools](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/about/#design-principles) for building enterprise-grade services and applications. It guides developers through proven [best practices](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/about/#best-practices) and a great wealth of [out-of-the-box solutions](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/about/features) for recurring tasks.

CAP-based projects benefit from a primary [focus on domain](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/about/#domain-models). Instead of delving into overly technical disciplines, we focus on [accelerated development](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/about/#grow-as-you-go), and [safeguarding investments](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/about/#platform-agnostic) in a world of rapidly changing cloud technologies.
