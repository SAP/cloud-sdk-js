# cloud-sdk-analytics

This package contains the code we use for collecting usage data.
Please note that usage analytics is disabled by default, i.e. you need to explicitly opt-in for data to be collected.
For more information on how to opt-in and which data is collected, please refer to [this document](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js/blob/main/packages/analytics/usage-analytics.md).
