# @sap-cloud-sdk/core

This package contains the core functionality of the SAP Cloud SDK as well as the Cloud Platform abstractions.

## Installation

```
$ npm install @sap-cloud-sdk/core
```

## Usage

The core is the heart of the SAP Cloud SDK and contains the functionality that is essential to every project powered by the SDK.
Any OData client built by the SAP Cloud SDK, be it the VDM or clients built by the generator are using the core.
We recommend to install this in addition to your clients.

Below is an example showing how you can build and execute your request with multiple filters by using an function called `and`.

```
import { and } from '@sap-cloud-sdk/core';
import { BusinessPartner } from '@sap/cloud-sdk-vdm-business-partner-service';

// Build your filters
const firstNameFilter = BusinessPartner.FIRST_NAME.equals('firstName');
const lastNameFilter = BusinessPartner.LAST_NAME.equals('lastName');

// Execute your request with two filters
BusinessPartner.requestBuilder()
 .getAll()
 .filter(and(firstNameFilter, lastNameFilter))
 .execute(yourDestination);
```
