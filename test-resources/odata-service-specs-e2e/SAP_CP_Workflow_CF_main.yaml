  title: Workflow API for Cloud Foundry
  description: >
    This API in the SAP Cloud SDK uses the SAP Cloud Platform Workflow service
    REST API. With the API, you can, for example, start new workflow instances
    and work with tasks.

    <br/>

    For more information on how to obtain the necessary parameters, please see
    <a
    href="https://help.sap.com/viewer/e157c391253b4ecd93647bf232d18a83/Cloud/en-US/abb1f66b2c3b4983b6b656654cfc3d2b.html">Determine
    Service Configuration Parameters</a> in the documentation. The OAuth client
    you use must have <a
    href="https://help.sap.com/viewer/e157c391253b4ecd93647bf232d18a83/Cloud/en-US/baf2847f6d1c401a83ca3a1427b8ff84.html">extended
    scopes</a>.  

    <br/>Note: The underlying REST APIs are designed for loosely coupled
    clients. This means:  

    <ul><li>If workflow service adds fields to responses, the REST API version
    number does not increase. REST API clients must ignore new fields. These
    fields become available in the Workflow API in the SAP Cloud SDK only in new
    versions of the SDK.</li>  

    <li>The order of fields in responses and of entries in arrays may change.
    This applies unless the API provides an explicit means to specify the
    desired order.</li></ul>

      description: >
        Retrieves workflow instances by parameters. If no parameters are
        specified, all RUNNING, or ERRONEOUS instances are returned.

        Parameters for different attributes of the instance are evaluated using
        the logical 'and' operator. If multiple parameters are

        specified for the same attribute or a parameter is specified multiple
        times, results are matched using the logical 'or' operator,

        unless noted otherwise. Empty parameters are treated as if they were not
        given.

            The sort attribute and direction are separated by a space.

            The parameter value is case-sensitive. You can only specify one
            ordering parameter, which contains attribute and direction.

            If sort by definitionVersion is enabled, then definitionId is also
            added to the sorting query.

            If not specified, the results are sorted by the 'startedAt'
            attribute, in descending order.

            You can specify parameters for other attributes in an analogous way.

      description: >-
        Modifies the properties of a given workflow instance, for example, sets
        its status to CANCELED or RUNNING.


        Status change effects may not take effect immediately, due to
        asynchronous processing of the request. When you change the status to
        CANCELED, note the following:


        * Workflow instances in CANCELED status are considered final, that is,
        no further changes are allowed. This is valid as well for other APIs and
        the processing according to the workflow definition.


        * Workflow instances in CANCELED status stop processing as soon as the
        system allows.


        When you are changing the status to SUSPENDED, note the following:


        * Status SUSPENDED manually and temporarily suspends processing.


        * Workflow instances in SUSPENDED status stop processing as soon as the
        system allows.


        * Workflow instances remain in SUSPENDED status until a status change to
        RUNNING or CANCELED is requested.


        * While the workflow instance status reported by the respective API
        might change with immediate effect, follow-up actions might only be
        successful, after asynchronous processing within the workflow instance
        actually has stopped. To check whether asynchronous processing is
        ongoing, analyze the execution logs or check the workflow definition
        structure.


        When you are changing the status to RUNNING, note the following:


        * For workflow instances in ERRONEOUS status, this retries the failed
        activities. If these activities continue failing, the workflow instance
        automatically moves again into ERRONEOUS status.


        * If the workflow instance had previously been suspended while in
        ERRONEOUS status, failed activities, such as service tasks, are retried.

        Any of the role assignment properties that is present in the request
        body will overwrite the existing assignments with the new

        assignments. Any properties that are either null or not present at all
        in the request body will leave the corresponding role

        assignments unchanged.


        The maximum number of users and groups that can be assigned to each role
        is limited to 100.


        The use of expressions as part of the role assignments (e.g.
        ${context.variable}) is only allowed for workflow instances that are

        not yet COMPLETED or CANCELED.

        - Setting **viewerUsers: "UserId1, UserId8"** will remove all existing
        user assignments of the viewer role and then assign
          only the two specified users to the role.
        - Setting **viewerUsers: ""** will remove all existing user assignments
        of the viewer role.

        - Specifying any non-null **viewerUsers** in the request body and
        leaving out **viewerGroups** will update the user
          assignments and leave the group assignments unchanged.

      description: >-
        Sends a message to a set of workflow instances for consumption in
        intermediate message events. The message is identified by the name
        specified in the workflow model (request body parameter 'definitionId') 

        and parameters identifying the workflow instances that should consume
        the message. 


        The message is consumed by the workflow instances that match the
        following criteria:


        * The instance can be a specific match when using its workflow instance
        ID (request body parameter 'workflowInstanceId'). 

        Or the instance is a generic match when using the ID of the workflow
        model together with the business key (request body parameters
        'workflowDefinitionId' respectively 'businessKey').

        You can either use the specific or generic match but not both in the
        same call.


        * The workflow instance is not in the SUSPENDED state.


        * The workflow instance currently waits at the intermediate message
        event referring to the specified message.


        The business key of a workflow instance matches if the business key
        specified in the request body is the same.  


        Roles permitted to execute this operation:
         - Global roles:  WorkflowMessageSender
         - Scope: MESSAGE_SEND
      parameters:

            Specify the request body according to the given schema.

            The length of the request body is limited to ensure optimal
            operation of the service.
