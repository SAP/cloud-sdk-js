  title: Workflow API for Cloud Foundry
  description: |
    This API uses the SAP Cloud Platform Workflow service. With the API, you can, for example, start new workflow instances and work with tasks.

    Note (relevant only for SAP API Business Hub): For authentication purposes, the API uses OAuth 2.0 security (with JSON Web Token, JWT). Thus, "Try Out" only works with an explicitly configured environment.
    For more information on how to obtain the necessary parameters, please see [Determine Service Configuration Parameters](https://help.sap.com/viewer/e157c391253b4ecd93647bf232d18a83/Cloud/en-US/abb1f66b2c3b4983b6b656654cfc3d2b.html) in the documentation.
    The OAuth client you use must have [extended scopes](https://help.sap.com/viewer/e157c391253b4ecd93647bf232d18a83/Cloud/en-US/baf2847f6d1c401a83ca3a1427b8ff84.html).

    Note: These APIs are designed for loosely coupled clients. This means:

    - If workflow service adds fields to responses, the API version number does not increase. Your client must ignore new fields.
    - The order of fields in responses and of entries in arrays may change. This applies unless the API provides an explicit means to specify the desired order.

      - User Task Instances
      description: |-
        Retrieves user task instances by parameters. If no parameters are specified, all instances with status READY, RESERVED, CANCELED, or COMPLETED are returned.
        Parameters for different attributes of the instance are evaluated using the logical 'and' operator. If a parameter is specified multiple times,
        results are matched using the logical 'or' operator, unless noted otherwise. Empty parameters are treated as if they were not specified.
        By default, returned tasks are sorted by creation time in ascending order.

        Roles permitted to execute this operation:
          - Global roles: WorkflowViewer, WorkflowAdmin
          - Instance-specific roles: viewerUsers, viewerGroups, adminUsers, adminGroups [Prerequisite: You are assigned to the WorkflowParticipant global role.]

          If a query by custom task attributes matches too many task definitions, you have to limit the query further. Refer, for example, to parameter 'definitionId'.

          If the custom task attribute IDs from the query match more than 50 task definitions, you have to specify one or more task definition IDs when searching for tasks by custom task attributes.

        Modifies the properties of a given workflow instance, for example, sets its status to CANCELED or RUNNING.

        Status change effects may not take effect immediately, due to asynchronous processing of the request. When you change the status to CANCELED, note the following:

        * Workflow instances in CANCELED status are considered final, that is, no further changes are allowed. This is valid as well for other APIs and the processing according to the workflow definition.

        * Workflow instances in CANCELED status stop processing as soon as the system allows.

        When you are changing the status to SUSPENDED, note the following:

        * Status SUSPENDED manually and temporarily suspends processing.

        * Workflow instances in SUSPENDED status stop processing as soon as the system allows.

        * Workflow instances remain in SUSPENDED status until a status change to RUNNING or CANCELED is requested.

        * While the workflow instance status reported by the respective API might change with immediate effect, follow-up actions might only be successful, after asynchronous processing within the workflow instance actually has stopped. To check whether asynchronous processing is ongoing, analyze the execution logs or check the workflow definition structure.

        When you are changing the status to RUNNING, note the following:

        * For workflow instances in ERRONEOUS status, this retries the failed activities. If these activities continue failing, the workflow instance automatically moves again into ERRONEOUS status.

        * If the workflow instance had previously been suspended while in ERRONEOUS status, failed activities, such as service tasks, are retried.
